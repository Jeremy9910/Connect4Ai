In this game, your objective is to get a certain number of your checkers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board before your opponent. When it's your turn, you “drop” one of your checkers into one of the columns at the top of the board. Then, let your opponent take their turn. This means each move may be trying to either win for you, or trying to stop your opponent from winning. The default number is four-in-a-row, but we’ll have other options to come soon.
